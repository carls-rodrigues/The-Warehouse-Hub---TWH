# TASK-010: OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana Integration

## Task Overview

**Estimated Hours**: 32 hours
**Priority**: P0 (Critical)
**Assignee**: dev-agent-5 (Observability & Security)

## Description

Integrate OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing, Prometheus for metrics collection, and Grafana for visualization dashboards to provide comprehensive observability for The Warehouse Hub.

## Technical Requirements

### OpenTelemetry Integration

- [ ] Add OpenTelemetry Rust SDK to Cargo.toml
- [ ] Configure tracing for HTTP requests, database queries, and business logic
- [ ] Set up span attributes for tenant_id, user_id, operation_type
- [ ] Implement custom metrics for business KPIs
- [ ] Configure trace sampling and export to Jaeger/OTEL collector

### Prometheus Metrics

- [ ] Expose `/metrics` endpoint for Prometheus scraping
- [ ] Implement core metrics:
  - HTTP request duration and count by endpoint
  - Database query performance
  - Business metrics (orders processed, webhooks delivered)
  - Error rates and types
  - Resource usage (CPU, memory, connections)
- [ ] Add tenant-specific metrics with proper labeling
- [ ] Configure metric aggregation and histograms

### Grafana Dashboards

- [ ] Create system health dashboard
- [ ] Build business metrics dashboard
- [ ] Design tenant usage dashboard
- [ ] Set up alerting rules for critical metrics
- [ ] Configure dashboard permissions and sharing

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: OpenTelemetry Setup (8 hours)

1. Add OpenTelemetry dependencies
2. Configure basic tracing for HTTP layer
3. Set up span propagation
4. Test trace collection

### Phase 2: Prometheus Metrics (12 hours)

1. Implement metrics collection
2. Add business logic instrumentation
3. Configure metric exposition
4. Test metric scraping

### Phase 3: Grafana Dashboards (8 hours)

1. Create dashboard JSON templates
2. Configure data sources
3. Set up alerting rules
4. Test dashboard functionality

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing (4 hours)

1. End-to-end testing
2. Performance validation
3. Documentation updates

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] OpenTelemetry traces collected for all major operations
- [ ] Prometheus metrics exposed and scraped successfully
- [ ] Grafana dashboards display accurate data
- [ ] Alerting configured for critical thresholds
- [ ] No performance degradation (<5% overhead)
- [ ] Documentation updated with monitoring setup

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- [ ] OpenTelemetry span creation
- [ ] Metric collection accuracy
- [ ] Dashboard configuration validation

### Integration Tests

- [ ] End-to-end tracing flow
- [ ] Metric exposition and scraping
- [ ] Dashboard data accuracy

### Performance Tests

- [ ] Observability overhead measurement
- [ ] System performance with monitoring enabled

## Dependencies

- **External**: OpenTelemetry collector, Prometheus server, Grafana instance
- **Internal**: Existing HTTP middleware, database connection pooling
- **Infrastructure**: Monitoring infrastructure provisioning

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Performance overhead | Start with minimal tracing, add incrementally |
| Complex configuration | Use established patterns and libraries |
| Data volume | Implement sampling and aggregation |
| Learning curve | Pair programming and documentation |

## Success Metrics

- **Tracing Coverage**: >90% of critical paths traced
- **Metrics Completeness**: All core business and system metrics collected
- **Dashboard Usage**: All key stakeholders can access relevant dashboards
- **Alert Effectiveness**: <5 minute mean time to detection for critical issues

## Files to Modify

- `Cargo.toml`: Add OpenTelemetry dependencies
- `src/main.rs`: Configure tracing and metrics
- `src/presentation/routes/mod.rs`: Add metrics endpoint
- `src/application/use_cases/`: Add instrumentation to business logic
- `docs/monitoring/`: Create monitoring documentation

## Definition of Done

- [ ] OpenTelemetry fully integrated and tracing operational
- [ ] Prometheus metrics endpoint functional and metrics accurate
- [ ] Grafana dashboards created and populated with data
- [ ] Alerting rules configured and tested
- [ ] Performance impact documented and acceptable
- [ ] Team trained on monitoring tools and procedures
- [ ] Production deployment configuration ready</content>
