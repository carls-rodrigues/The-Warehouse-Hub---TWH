# TASK-028: Audit Logs Endpoints

## Task Overview

**Estimated Hours**: 8 hours
**Priority**: P0 (Critical)
**Assignee**: dev-agent-1 (API Development)

## Description

Implement comprehensive audit logging for compliance, security monitoring, and operational visibility in The Warehouse Hub.

## Technical Requirements

### Audit Log Schema
- [ ] Design audit log database schema
- [ ] Define audit event types and categories
- [ ] Implement structured logging format
- [ ] Add tenant and user context to all logs
- [ ] Configure log retention policies

### Audit Event Collection
- [ ] Implement automatic logging for sensitive operations
- [ ] Add audit logging to authentication events
- [ ] Log data access and modification events
- [ ] Implement configurable audit levels
- [ ] Add business logic audit events

### API Endpoints
- [ ] Implement GET /admin/audit-logs endpoint
- [ ] Add filtering by tenant, user, event type, date range
- [ ] Implement pagination for large result sets
- [ ] Add export functionality (CSV/JSON)
- [ ] Create admin UI for audit log viewing

### Security & Compliance
- [ ] Implement audit log integrity protection
- [ ] Add tamper-evident logging mechanisms
- [ ] Ensure audit logs cannot be modified or deleted
- [ ] Implement compliance reporting features
- [ ] Add audit log access controls

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Schema & Infrastructure (3 hours)
1. Design audit log database schema
2. Create audit logging service
3. Set up logging infrastructure
4. Test basic audit logging

### Phase 2: Event Collection (3 hours)
1. Implement automatic audit logging
2. Add audit events to key operations
3. Configure audit levels and filtering
4. Test audit event collection

### Phase 3: API & UI (2 hours)
1. Implement audit log API endpoints
2. Add filtering and pagination
3. Create basic admin interface
4. Test API functionality

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Audit logs collected for all sensitive operations
- [ ] API endpoints functional with filtering and pagination
- [ ] Admin interface for viewing audit logs
- [ ] Audit log integrity maintained
- [ ] Compliance requirements met
- [ ] Performance impact acceptable (<5% overhead)

## Security Considerations

- [ ] Audit logs protected from unauthorized access
- [ ] Tamper-evident logging mechanisms
- [ ] Secure storage and retention policies
- [ ] Compliance with data protection regulations
- [ ] Incident response procedures for audit log access

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Audit log creation and storage
- [ ] API endpoint functionality
- [ ] Filtering and pagination logic

### Integration Tests
- [ ] End-to-end audit logging workflow
- [ ] Admin interface functionality
- [ ] Performance testing with large datasets

### Compliance Testing
- [ ] Audit log integrity verification
- [ ] Access control testing
- [ ] Retention policy validation

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Performance impact from logging | Medium | Asynchronous logging and sampling |
| Storage requirements for audit logs | Medium | Configurable retention and archiving |
| Audit log access security | High | Strict access controls and monitoring |
| Compliance gaps | Critical | Regular compliance audits and updates |

## Success Metrics

- **Coverage**: 100% of sensitive operations audited
- **Performance**: <5% application performance impact
- **Security**: Zero unauthorized audit log access incidents
- **Compliance**: All regulatory audit requirements met

## Files to Modify

- Database schema for audit logs
- `src/application/services/`: Add audit logging service
- `src/presentation/routes/`: Add audit log endpoints
- `src/presentation/handlers/`: Implement audit log handlers
- Admin UI components for audit log viewing

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Audit log schema implemented and tested
- [ ] Automatic audit logging operational
- [ ] API endpoints functional and documented
- [ ] Admin interface for audit log viewing
- [ ] Security and compliance requirements met
- [ ] Performance benchmarks acceptable
- [ ] Documentation updated for audit logging</content>
