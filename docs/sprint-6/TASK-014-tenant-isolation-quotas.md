# TASK-014: Tenant Isolation & Quotas

## Task Overview

**Estimated Hours**: 56 hours
**Priority**: P0 (Critical)
**Assignee**: dev-agent-3 (Backend Core)

## Description

Implement robust multi-tenancy isolation and usage quotas to ensure tenant data security and fair resource allocation in The Warehouse Hub.

## Technical Requirements

### Database Row-Level Security (RLS)
- [ ] Enable PostgreSQL RLS on all tenant-related tables
- [ ] Create security policies for tenant data isolation
- [ ] Implement tenant context propagation through all database operations
- [ ] Add tenant_id to all relevant database schemas
- [ ] Test RLS policy enforcement

### API Rate Limiting
- [ ] Implement Redis-based rate limiting per tenant
- [ ] Configure different tiers (free, basic, premium)
- [ ] Add rate limit headers to API responses
- [ ] Implement graceful degradation when limits exceeded
- [ ] Create admin override capabilities

### Storage Quotas
- [ ] Implement storage usage tracking per tenant
- [ ] Set configurable storage limits by tenant tier
- [ ] Add storage usage monitoring and alerts
- [ ] Implement cleanup policies for quota violations
- [ ] Create storage usage reporting

### Resource Usage Monitoring
- [ ] Track API calls per tenant per hour/day
- [ ] Monitor database connection usage
- [ ] Implement resource usage dashboards
- [ ] Set up alerting for quota violations
- [ ] Create usage analytics for billing

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Database Security (16 hours)
1. Analyze current database schema for tenant isolation gaps
2. Implement RLS policies on core tables
3. Add tenant context to database operations
4. Test isolation between tenants

### Phase 2: Rate Limiting (16 hours)
1. Set up Redis rate limiting infrastructure
2. Implement middleware for API rate limiting
3. Configure tenant-specific limits
4. Test rate limiting behavior

### Phase 3: Storage Quotas (12 hours)
1. Implement storage usage tracking
2. Add quota enforcement logic
3. Create storage monitoring dashboards
4. Test quota violation handling

### Phase 4: Monitoring & Alerts (12 hours)
1. Implement usage monitoring
2. Set up alerting for quota violations
3. Create admin reporting tools
4. Performance testing and optimization

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Complete tenant data isolation via RLS
- [ ] API rate limiting functional per tenant
- [ ] Storage quotas enforced and monitored
- [ ] Resource usage tracking and alerting
- [ ] No cross-tenant data access possible
- [ ] Admin tools for quota management

## Security Considerations

- [ ] Defense in depth with application and database level isolation
- [ ] Secure tenant context propagation
- [ ] Audit logging of isolation violations
- [ ] Regular security testing of multi-tenancy
- [ ] Incident response procedures for breaches

## Testing Strategy

### Security Testing
- [ ] Penetration testing for tenant isolation
- [ ] Data leakage prevention testing
- [ ] Authentication bypass attempts

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Rate limiting performance impact
- [ ] Database query performance with RLS
- [ ] Scalability with multiple tenants

### Integration Testing
- [ ] End-to-end tenant operations
- [ ] Quota enforcement workflows
- [ ] Admin quota management

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| RLS performance degradation | High | Optimize queries and monitor performance |
| Rate limiting false positives | Medium | Implement gradual limit increases |
| Storage quota calculation errors | Medium | Thorough testing and monitoring |
| Tenant context propagation bugs | Critical | Comprehensive testing and code review |

## Success Metrics

- **Security**: Zero cross-tenant data access incidents
- **Performance**: <10% overhead from isolation measures
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime with quota enforcement
- **Usability**: Transparent quota management for tenants

## Files to Modify

- `src/domain/entities/`: Add tenant context to entities
- `src/infrastructure/database/`: Implement RLS policies
- `src/presentation/middleware/`: Add tenant isolation middleware
- `src/application/services/`: Add quota enforcement services
- Database migrations for tenant isolation

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Database RLS policies implemented and tested
- [ ] API rate limiting functional and configurable
- [ ] Storage quotas enforced with proper monitoring
- [ ] Resource usage tracking and alerting operational
- [ ] Security audit completed with zero critical findings
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet requirements
- [ ] Documentation updated for multi-tenancy setup</content>
