# TASK-017: KMS/Vault Integration & HMAC Webhook Signing

## Task Overview

**Estimated Hours**: 24 hours
**Priority**: P0 (Critical)
**Assignee**: dev-agent-5 (Observability & Security)

## Description

Integrate Key Management Service (KMS) and Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) for secure webhook delivery and secret management in The Warehouse Hub.

## Technical Requirements

### KMS/Vault Integration
- [ ] Set up KMS/Vault client in Rust application
- [ ] Implement secret storage and retrieval
- [ ] Configure automatic secret rotation
- [ ] Add secret versioning and rollback capabilities
- [ ] Implement secure key generation for webhooks

### HMAC Webhook Signing
- [ ] Generate unique webhook secrets per subscription
- [ ] Implement HMAC-SHA256 signature calculation
- [ ] Add signature validation middleware
- [ ] Include timestamp validation to prevent replay attacks
- [ ] Provide signature verification utilities

### Webhook Security Hardening
- [ ] Implement request size limits
- [ ] Add rate limiting for webhook endpoints
- [ ] Configure secure headers (HSTS, CSP, etc.)
- [ ] Implement webhook delivery logging
- [ ] Add webhook failure alerting

### Secret Management
- [ ] Migrate existing secrets to KMS/Vault
- [ ] Implement secret access auditing
- [ ] Create secret rotation procedures
- [ ] Add emergency secret revocation
- [ ] Implement secret backup and recovery

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: KMS/Vault Setup (8 hours)
1. Configure KMS/Vault client
2. Set up secret storage infrastructure
3. Implement basic secret operations
4. Test secret retrieval and storage

### Phase 2: HMAC Implementation (8 hours)
1. Implement HMAC signature generation
2. Create signature validation middleware
3. Add timestamp validation
4. Test webhook signature verification

### Phase 3: Security Hardening (6 hours)
1. Implement webhook security measures
2. Add rate limiting and monitoring
3. Configure secure headers
4. Test security implementations

### Phase 4: Migration & Testing (2 hours)
1. Migrate existing secrets
2. End-to-end testing
3. Documentation updates

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] KMS/Vault integration functional for secret management
- [ ] HMAC webhook signatures implemented and validated
- [ ] Webhook endpoints hardened against attacks
- [ ] Secret rotation procedures documented
- [ ] Security audit completed with no critical findings
- [ ] All secrets migrated to secure storage

## Security Considerations

- [ ] Never log sensitive secret information
- [ ] Implement principle of least privilege for secret access
- [ ] Regular security audits of secret management
- [ ] Incident response procedures for secret compromise
- [ ] Compliance with data protection regulations

## Testing Strategy

### Security Testing
- [ ] Webhook signature validation testing
- [ ] Secret access control verification
- [ ] Penetration testing of webhook endpoints
- [ ] Secret leakage prevention testing

### Integration Testing
- [ ] End-to-end webhook delivery with signatures
- [ ] Secret rotation workflows
- [ ] KMS/Vault integration testing

### Compliance Testing
- [ ] Security audit requirements verification
- [ ] Regulatory compliance validation

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| KMS service outages | High | Implement fallback mechanisms |
| Webhook signature failures | Medium | Graceful degradation and alerting |
| Secret rotation issues | Critical | Thorough testing and rollback procedures |
| Security vulnerabilities | Critical | Regular security reviews and updates |

## Success Metrics

- **Security**: Zero security incidents related to webhooks or secrets
- **Reliability**: 99.9% webhook delivery success rate
- **Compliance**: 100% audit requirements met
- **Performance**: <2% overhead from security measures

## Files to Modify

- `Cargo.toml`: Add KMS/Vault and crypto dependencies
- `src/infrastructure/security/`: New security infrastructure
- `src/presentation/middleware/`: Add webhook security middleware
- `src/application/services/`: Add secret management services
- Environment configuration for KMS/Vault

## Definition of Done

- [ ] KMS/Vault integration complete and tested
- [ ] HMAC webhook signing implemented and validated
- [ ] Webhook endpoints security-hardened
- [ ] Secret management procedures documented
- [ ] Security audit passed
- [ ] Production deployment configuration ready</content>
