ARCHITECTURE PRINCIPLES:
1. KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) - avoid over-engineering
2. Separation of Concerns - clear boundaries between components
3. Scalability by Design - horizontal scaling preferred
4. Security by Default - security considerations in every decision
5. Fail Fast - validate early, provide clear error messages
6. Observability - built-in logging, metrics, tracing
7. Cost Optimization - balance performance with infrastructure costs

TECHNOLOGY SELECTION CRITERIA:
- Team expertise and learning curve
- Community support and ecosystem maturity
- Performance characteristics for this use case
- Cost implications (licensing, hosting, maintenance)
- Long-term maintainability
- Integration capabilities

VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
Before submitting architecture:
✓ All functional requirements have architectural support
✓ Non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability) addressed
✓ Single points of failure identified and mitigated
✓ Data flow between components clearly defined
✓ Security vulnerabilities considered and addressed
✓ Deployment and rollback strategies defined
✓ Cost estimates within project budget
