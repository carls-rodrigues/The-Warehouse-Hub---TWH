- Outbound sales: enterprise outreach focusing on 3PL, marketplaces, and retailers with complex inventory needs.

Conversion and funnel
- Activation flow: signup -> sandbox tenant -> sample data -> run quickstart -> first successful API call within 10 minutes.  
- Nudges: in-console usage alerts, projected month-end usage, one-click upgrade CTAs, and trial auto-upgrade for 14 days.  
- Sales motions: self-serve for Developer and Startup; sales-assisted for Growth and Scale; enterprise-led for custom deals.

Pricing experiments and promotions
- Early adopter pilot discounts in exchange for case studies.  
- Promo codes for partner referrals and incubator startups.  
- A/B test Developer price and free trial length to optimize conversion.

Customer success and retention
- Self-service docs and SDKs with examples for ETag and idempotency flows.  
- Community-first support initially using OSS CRM; escalate top accounts to direct founder support.  
- Onboarding checklist, migration guides and reconciliation playbooks for paid plans.  
- Regular usage reports and monthly check-ins for Growth+ customers.

# Operations and Organization

Lean org model
- Solo-founder until validated revenue and scale signals. Founder responsibilities: product, development, ops, devex, and initial sales.  
- Hire timeline: contract DevOps/SRE coach at $X/month when MRR > $Y; hire senior backend engineer and pre-sales engineer as Growth tier penetration increases; assign CSM or outsource support for enterprise customers.

Infrastructure and run operations
- Solo-founder initial stack: single VM or small VPS running reverse proxy, API, worker, Postgres, Redis, RabbitMQ, MinIO, and Meilisearch; monthly infra budget conservative estimate $400.  
- Production cloud ops when growth demands: managed Postgres, Kafka/Cloud Streaming, Redis cluster, S3, Kubernetes, and observability services.  
- Key operational playbooks: incident response, DB restore (PITR), webhook DLQ handling, reconciliation runbook, on-call triage.

Security and compliance
- Implement security foundations from day one: TLS everywhere, secret vault, HMAC-signed webhooks, audit logging, RBAC for console.  
- Prepare SOC2 readiness checklist and start control mapping early to accelerate enterprise sales.  
- Enterprise contract templates include data processing addendum, SLA definitions, and onboarding scope.

Support model
- Phase 1: community support and email to founder; prioritized responses for paying customers.  
- Phase 2: add shared Slack channel for Growth customers, prioritized ticketing, and scheduled onboarding sessions.  
- Phase 3: assign dedicated CSM for Enterprise with quarterly business reviews and migration assistance.

# Financial Plan

Revenue model assumptions
- Pricing as defined in Product Strategy.  
- Conservative conversion funnel for year 1: Free signups -> 5% convert to Developer/Startup; of those 25% upgrade to Growth/Scale within 12 months; initiate enterprise pilots converting to paid in months 6–12.

Cost structure initial
- Founder compensation deferred initially.  
- Infrastructure self-hosted baseline $400/mo.  
- Developer tooling and domain $100/mo.  
- Marketing and content $300/mo.  
- Contingency and legal $200/mo.  
- Total baseline monthly fixed costs $1,000–$1,500.

Break-even and targets
- Break-even by revenue at ~ $1,300/mo under self-hosted assumptions.  
- Conservative go-to-market target to reach breakeven: 30 Startup customers or 5 Growth customers.  
- Target for sustainable growth and hiring: $20k MRR to justify first full-time hire and managed infra.

12-month financial milestones
- Month 0–3: product launch, initial free adoption, 0–10 paying customers, MRR <$1k.  
- Month 4–6: achieve product-market fit signals and 30–50 paying customers, MRR $2k–$5k.  
- Month 7–12: scale MRR to $10k–$30k with Growth tier traction and 1–3 enterprise pilots.

Cash flow, pricing sensitivity and scenarios
- Model conservative, base, and aggressive scenarios showing customer counts required per tier to reach $5k, $20k, and $50k MRR.  
- Prioritize enterprise pilots and Growth tier conversion to improve revenue-per-customer and reduce churn risk.  
- Maintain runway by minimizing fixed costs until MRR > $5k.

# Risks and Mitigations

Technical risks
- Data inconsistency between ledger and snapshots. Mitigation: require atomic write of stock_movements and stock_levels within single-shard transactions and nightly reconciliation job with alerts.  
- Scaling failures under burst traffic. Mitigation: token-bucket rate-limiter, reserved capacity for paying tenants, early load testing.  
- Webhook delivery failures. Mitigation: DLQ, replay API, per-subscription backpressure, and robust signing.

Business risks
- Slow developer adoption. Mitigation: invest in docs, sample apps, and community channels; aggressive Free tier; RapidAPI listing and developer outreach.  
- Pricing not competitive. Mitigation: run A/B pricing tests, monitor upgrade triggers, and adjust limits and add-ons.  
- Reliance on solo-founder capacity. Mitigation: hire contractors for critical ops, limit initial support promises, and automate onboarding and metering.

Operational risks
- Billing disputes from metering errors. Mitigation: build accurate metering, transparent dashboards, and easy-to-understand invoices with dispute resolution flow.  
- Legal and compliance gaps. Mitigation: implement privacy and security basics early and engage counsel before major enterprise deals.
