**GET /jobs/{jobId} - Status Retrieval:**

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/jobs/job_31c8927959d5442e90e3a6bc5a9188ec
```

**Response:**

```json

  "type": "test_job",

}
```

**Database Verification:**

```sql
SELECT job_id, tenant_id, type, status FROM jobs;
-- job_31c8927959d5442e90e3a6bc5a9188ec | 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000 | test_job | QUEUED
```

#### 🔧 Technical Architecture

**Job Status Lifecycle:**

```rust
pub enum JobStatus {
    Queued,      // Initial state
    Running,     // Processing started
    Success,     // Completed successfully
    Failed,      // Failed with errors
    PartialSuccess, // Completed with some errors
}
```

**Async Processing Pattern:**

```rust
// Job creation and immediate queuing
let job = Job::new(tenant_id, job_type, Some(payload))?;
job_service.enqueue_job(job).await?;

// Worker framework ready for background processing
let worker = WorkerManager::new(job_service, job_processor);
worker.run().await; // Processes jobs asynchronously
```

**Database Schema:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE jobs (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    job_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    tenant_id UUID NOT NULL,
    type VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'QUEUED',
    progress INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    payload JSONB,
    result_url VARCHAR(500),
    errors JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    started_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
    completed_at TIMESTAMPTZ
);
```
